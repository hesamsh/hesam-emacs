The article is well written and organized. However there are several
lacks or imperfections. The tools and plots which are used in the
paper could be clear and easy to understand. Comparison plot for
expected and actual results is a useful tool. The paper structure
needs to have more clear explanations. There exist unnecessary
explanations. The conclusions should include summarizing of the all
analysis. The overall study satisfies all project goals but there
exist some imperfections.
