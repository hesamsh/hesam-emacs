\section{Typos}
\label{sec-1}
\begin{itemize}
\item The reference 28 which is mentioned in the context several times,
the author name has typos.
\end{itemize}
\section{The proposition 1 proof}
\label{sec-2}
Th proposition 1 proof has lack of information. The authors assume
that the number of jobs equals to $k$. They also define a variable
$d_j$ without explanation. The proof is vague.
\section{Section 5}
\label{sec-3}
In the section 5, the authors propose FPTAS for the problem with three
machine and fixed transportation delay. The proposed algorithm and
other related developments are those which are described in Haned, A.,
Soukhal, A., Boudhar, M., \& Tuong, N. H. (2012). Scheduling on
parallel machines with preemption and transportation delays. Computers
\& Operations Research, 39(2), 374-381. Since the method does not work
for the general problem, the new authors revised it for three machine
problem. I believe this should be published as a note for the previous
paper.
\section{Section 6}
\label{sec-4}
In the section 6, the authors assert that the proposed method satisfy
for a general problem in which the transportation delays are
arbitrary and can be different. There exist a neglecting, because the
authors use theorems and the conjecture which are proved for the problem with identical
transportation delays. It is not proved for the general problem with
arbitrary transportation delays. The method could be correct for the
problem with identical transportation delays.
In addition, when a conjecture is proved it is not a conjecture
anymore, it converts to theorem.
