* Title: Enhancing optimization algorithm via machine learning
** Abstract
We explore an application of classification techniques to binary
optimization. Given a set of solutions and the corresponding objective
values, the goal is to classify each solution component either as zero
or one. We implement statistical models based on random forests,
convolutional neural networks and logistic regression and compare
their performance on a set of scheduling problems. A learning module
based on an efficient logistic regression model is embedded into the
tabu search method. The comparison with standard tabu implementations
reveals significant gains in efficiency.
