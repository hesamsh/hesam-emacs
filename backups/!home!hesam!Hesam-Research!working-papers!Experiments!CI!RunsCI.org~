Dear Dr. Shylo

I ran several experiments for the problem ta21 as follows. (10 runs
for each class)

|------------------+---------------|
| expid            | Algorithm     |
|------------------+---------------|
| CI01 to CI11     | Directed Tabu |
| NCI01 to NCI11   | Directed Tabu |
| CIT01 to CIT11   | Standard Tabu |
| NCIT01 to NCIT11 | Standard Tabu |

I think it's interesting to see the plots I have attached. The
description of each plots are in the following table.


|----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 10 Runs  | (CI01 <= CIT01) vs. (NCI01 <= NCIT01)                                             |
| 20 Runs  | ([CI01,CI02] <= [CIT01,CIT02]) vs. ([NCI01,NCI02] <= [NCIT01,NCIT02])             |
| ...      | ...                                                                               |
| 100 Runs | ([CI01 .. CI10] <= [CIT01 .. CIT11]) vs. ([NCI01 .. NCI02] <= [NCIT01 .. NCIT02]) |

These are some updates and findings. I will appreciate if we can meet
in the coming days.
