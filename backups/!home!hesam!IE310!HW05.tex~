\section{Exercise 1 - Chapter 4 - Ross (10th Edition)}
\label{sec-1}
The random variable $\{X_n,n \ge 0\}$ denotes the state of the system by the
following definition. $X_n$ =\{Number of white balls in urn 1 after the
$n$-th step\}. We only need to know the numbers of white ball in urn 1 in the
$n$-th step and no furthermore. So we have the following for the probability.

\begin{align*}
P(X_{n+1}=j|X_n=i,X_{n-1}=i_{n-1},...,X_1=i_1, X_0=i_0)=P(X_{n+1}=j|X_n=i)
\end{align*}

The state $X_0$ depends on the number of white balls in the beginning
which has Binomial distribution ($X_0 \sim Bin(3,\frac{1}{3})$). On the
other hand, the probability of number of white balls increase/decrease
more than one after one step is zero. So, we have the followings.

\begin{align*}
P(X_{n+1}=j|X_n=i)=0, \forall j<i-1 \text{ and } j > i+1
\end{align*}

For all other states ($i=0,1,2,3$), we have the followings.

\begin{align*}
P(X_{n+1}=j|X_n=i)=
\begin{cases}
       (\frac{i}{3})^2 &\quad\text{if } j=i-1 \\
       2 \times \frac{i}{3} \times \frac{3-i}{3} &\quad\text{if }j=i \\
       (\frac{3-i}{3})^2 &\quad\text{if } j=i+1  \ 
\end{cases}
\end{align*}

So, we have the following probability based on what was mentioned.

\begin{align*}
P_{0,0}=0, \quad P_{0,1}=1, \quad P_{0,2}=0, \quad P_{0,3}=0 \\
P_{1,0}=\frac{1}{9}, \quad P_{1,1}=\frac{4}{9}, \quad P_{1,2}=\frac{4}{9}, \quad P_{1,3}=0 \\
P_{2,0}=0, \quad P_{2,1}=\frac{4}{9}, \quad P_{2,2}=\frac{4}{9}, \quad P_{2,3}=\frac{1}{9}\\
P_{3,0}=0, \quad P{3,1}=0, \quad P_{3,2}=1, \quad P_{3,3}=0
\end{align*}

So, we have the following probability matrix.

\begin{align*}
P =
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
\frac{1}{9} & \frac{4}{9} & \frac{4}{9} & 0 \\
0 & \frac{4}{9} & \frac{4}{9} & \frac{1}{9} \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}

\section{Exercise 2 - Chapter 4 - Ross (10th Edition)}
\label{sec-2}
Let $R$ denotes rainy and $D$ denotes dry. We have the following eight
states:

\begin{align*}
RRR, RRD, RDR, RDD, DRR, DRD, DDR, DDD
\end{align*}

where $RD$ represents today is dry, yesterday was dry, and the day
before yesterday was rain.

\section{Exercise 3 - Chapter 4 - Ross (10th Edition)}

The $P$ is as follows.

\label{sec-4}
No, the process does not have the Markov property (it is not time
homogeneous). The probabilities depend on time step $n$ and it is not
important $n$ is even or odd. There is no probability depends on state
and $n$.

In order to transform the process to a Markov process, we can expand
the state space as follows.

Let the state space $S=\{0, 1, 2, \bar{0}, \bar{1}, \bar{2} \}$ where
state $i$ denotes that the present value is $i$ and the present day is
even and $\bar{i}$ denotes that the present value is $\bar{i}$ and the
present day is odd $\forall i=\{0,1,2\}$. So, we have a unique $X_n$
for each state and it is Markov chain now.
