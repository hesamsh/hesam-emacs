\section{The Problem:}
\label{sec-1}
In this research project, we are studying traveling salesman problem
(TSP). The TSP is an important optimization problem which is related
to graph theory.

\section{The Algorithm:}
\label{sec-2}
Since TSP is np-complete problem, we need to develop an approximation
algorithm to solve it. There exist a tabu algorithm in the literature
implemented on TSP. We are going to code the standard tabu for the
TSP. Moreover, we developed a guided tabu algorithm (GTA) for optimization
problem which is using long term memory to improve the solution. We
also are going to code GTA as well.

\section{The Computational Results}
\label{sec-3}
We are going to implement both standard tabu and GTA on a benchmark
problems and compare the results and evaluate the efficiency of GTA in
compared to standard tabu.
The test problems are taken from \url{http://elib.zib.de/pub/mp-testdata/tsp/tsplib/tsplib.html}.
