The article is well written and uses good tools and plots to convey
the project in a scientific approach. The author avoids overstatements
and use a clear language to explain what are presented in the paper.
However there exist a few imperfections through organizing the  paper.
It could be useful to extend the introduction part and finalize this
part by paragraph describing what are other sections. The correct
methods are applied to analyze data. The conclusions section should be
summarize the  analysis in previous sections. This section does not
also contain comprehensive and clear conclusions. The overall study satisfies
all project goals, however there are several lacks.
