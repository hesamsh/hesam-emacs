The article is well written. The author uses good tools and plots to convey
the project in a scientific approach. However, using separated plots
for observed and expected results can be confusing. It would be better
to understand if observed and expected results were drawn in one
figure. The author avoids overstatements and uses a clear language to
explain what are presented in the paper. The paper is also well
organized and the correct methods were applied to analyze data. The
author concludes the provided plots and statistics test into a clear and
correct final summary. The overall study satisfies all project goals.
