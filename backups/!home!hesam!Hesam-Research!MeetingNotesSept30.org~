* Database
** TODO Create a database similar to the followings
exp_id, algo_name, problem_name, RunID, time, Solution
** TODO Code something to generate solution and save it to the database
** TODO Use random generating solution
** TODO Use SQLite to mange database
* Comparison 
** For each class of benchmark we can have something as follows
** Assume the following figure
*** One axis should be time, another axis should be objective value. This figure should be for one problem.
*** One axis should be time, another axis should be the probability of that the Tabu 1 has better solution than Tabu 2. The probability is equal to the followings:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\text{number of solutions in Tabu 1 better than Tabu 2 in time } t}{\text{total number of problems ran on both algorithms in time } t}
\end{equation}
