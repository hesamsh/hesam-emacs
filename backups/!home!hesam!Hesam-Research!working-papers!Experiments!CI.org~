* Introduction
A /confidence interval/ is a range of values from a lower bound to an
upper bound for a specific population. It is defined by $\theta_l \leq
\theta \leq \theta_u$ where $\theta$ is an unknown parameter with
confidence $1-\alpha$ and $\theta_0$ is a value which in the null
hypothesis $H_0: \theta = \theta_0$ have not been rejected in the
observed sample when a two-sided test with the type I error $\alpha$
was applied.

* Confidence Interval for Binomial Proportions
Assume there are $n$ independent Bernoulli trials with success
probability $\pi$ and the measurement scale of random variable is at
least nominal. Let $x$ be the number of successes in a random sample
of size $n$. A success is observed if $X_i$ has a specific
characteristic (in our problem, a success is observed if GTA obtains a
better solution than Tabu in a specific time). The proportion of
success in the sample is denoted by $\bar{\pi} = \frac{x}{n}$ and the
proportion in the population is denoted by $\pi$.

Generally, there exist two approaches for calculating confidence
interval in binomial proportions; exact and approximation.
** The Clopper-Pearson Interval
This method is the basic method for evaluation of confidence interval
and it is an *Exact* approach. For different values of $x$, the lower
and upper bounds of interval ($\pi_l \leq \pi \leq \pi_u$) with a
confidence coefficient of at least $1-\alpha$ are defined as follows:
\begin{align*}
\pi_l &= \frac{x}{x+(n-x+1)F_1} \\
\pi_u &= \frac{(x+1)F_2}{n-x+(x+1)F_2}
\end{align*}
where $F_1 = F_{2x, (1-\frac{\alpha}{2})}^{2n-2x+2}$ and $F_2 =
F_{2n-2x,, (1-\frac{\alpha}{2})}^{2x+2}$.

Agresti and Coull \ref{} indicate that this interval has coverage
probability bounded below by the nominal confidence level. In the
other words, this procedure is conservative.
