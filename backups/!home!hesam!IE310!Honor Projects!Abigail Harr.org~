The article is well written and uses good tools and plots to convey the project
in a scientific approach. The author avoids overstatements and uses a clear
language to explain what are presented in the paper. However, there
are imperfections in organizing the paper. It could be helpful to
extend the introduction part and finalize this part by a paragraph
including an outline. The correct methods are applied to analyze
data. The conclusions section should summarize analysis in the
previous sections. This section does not also contain comprehensive
and clear conclusions. The overall study satisfies all project goals,
however, there are several lacks.
